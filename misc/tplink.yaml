# Multiple "dumb" devices are made available through binary switches:
#   - 12v warm white 100-LED string fairy lights (x3)
#   - Basic oscillating fan
#   - Frigidaire FFAD7033R1 70-pint dehumidifier
#   - Nightstand with added 12v RGB LED strips
#
# Frigidaire FFAD7033R1:
# This dehumidifier is fast, less noisy than most and will auto-restart to its
# last condition in case of a power outage. This is great since we'll be
# controlling it with a smart power outlet. Its humistat is not used however:
# the device is run in continuous mode with humidity monitored by sensors
# throughout the dwelling. Automations take care of turning it on or off based
# on custom minimum and maximum humidity levels.
