# Change Lightpack based on its programmed profiles
#
# The Lightpack is controlled by the Prismatik softwage, which allows for
# different profiles to be created and loaded at will. They have unique names,
# but let's use a translation map here to reduce name binding between Home
# Assistant and daily HTPC usage.
